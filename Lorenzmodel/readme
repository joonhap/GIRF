runs the EnKF for d=50 dimensional Lorenz 96 with observation time interval = 0.5 and process noise = 1.0.
The EnKF can be run by using the pomp enkf() or the direct code (EnKF.R file from 191126/).


ALSO: changes Lorenzmod such that the forecast likelihoods can be estimated using the sample quantiles of forward simulations (instead of the sample variance of them)
The variable 'forecast_var' is now to be read as 'forecast_variability', and can be used to store sample quantile values.
For this reason, the dimension of the array 'forecast_var' increases by one (various quantile values have to be stored). Corresponding changes to stf_parallel.tpp, stf_parallel.h were made. Also changes to be made to measlesmod and linmod.

results: (d=50, obs_time_interval=0.5, nobs=200, max_lookahead=2, sample_quantiles--> used 8 quantile values out of forty simulations) (filenames without dtObs correspond to the case where the observation time interval = 0.5)

--> For d=50 and observation time interval = 0.5, the likelihood estimates by GIRF were higher than those by the EnKF. (see plots in figures/ directory)
